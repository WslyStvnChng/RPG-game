// //2. Arrays
// //===========================================================
// //Create an array to hold information
// //Create HP and attack power randomly using for loop to generate when user attacks with selected opponent and selected character

$(document).ready(function(){

}) 



// //3. Functions
//============================================================

// A)When game starts, user chooses a character by clicking fighter's picture; user can not reclick to another opponent
// B)The selected character is then placed into DEFEND AREA with Random opponent (use a for loop to randomize computer character)
// C)Within this function the ATTACK button should be affective
// D)When user clicks the ATTACK button, damages the defender and opponent losses HEALTH POINTS
    //The opponent will lose HEALTH POINTS
    //These points are displayed at the bottom of the screen
// E)Immediately after, opponent will COUNTER with their attack and user's character will dealt damage
    //The player character will lose some HP
    //These points are displayed at the bottom of the screen
// F)IF/Else statement:
//   If opponents HP is at 0, remove enemy from DEFEND ZONE; and USER picks a new opponent
//   If user's HP is at 0, game ends
// Within all these, need to INPUT HEALTHPOINTS into the html showing the attack damage
// G)Player wins the game by defeating all the enemy characters
// H)Each time the player attacks,
//  Their character attack power increases it's base attack power
// I)Check and se if there are any enemy in the defender zone
//  IF not, output a message to DOM
//  When enemy is defeated, output a message to DOM
// J)Enemy character only has COUNTER ATTACK POWER
//  REMEMBER: PLAYER CHOOSEN CHARACTER HAS ATTACK POINTS, COUNTER POWERS IT NEVER CHANGES
// K)The health points, attack power and counter power of each character must differ 



////////
//No characters in html, taking character creating one block of in js
//Render is each character on a page; each character has a class (need click event
//jQuery click event needs to add to character when click; which ever character is grabbed on grab the data from it. 
//append method - take content of text or whatever going to add to the end of the target
//append to the defender zone div 
//attack button with IF (runs if both selected character and opponent are in the defender zone)
//while loops ealth renders to opponnent health reaces zero 

// while (defender.health > 0) {
//     attacker.attacker(defender);
// }

// keeps running until it reaches 0 in this case and don't need to add if/else statements
//Need to check if enenmy
